## Installation

ivLyrics iOS is not publicly distributed yet. Only development builds are currently supported.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `ivLyrics-IOS.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Configure your developer account, bundle ID, and Spotify API settings for your local environment.
4. Run the app on a simulator or iOS device.

iOS builds are not available on GitHub Releases yet.

## Lyrics Page Tips

- Tap the title or artist once to open Spotify.
- Long-press the title/artist area on the main screen or lyrics page to open lyric settings.
- Tap a lyric line to jump to that position.
- Drag the progress bar to seek.
- If the timing feels off, adjust the sync offset from the lyric settings menu.
- If LRCLIB selected the wrong result, use manual LRCLIB search from the same menu.

## Translation, Pronunciation, and Furigana

ivLyrics iOS detects the song language automatically and stores translation and pronunciation settings separately for each language.

For example, you can enable both translation and pronunciation for Japanese songs, enable only translation for English songs, and disable both for Spanish songs. If the detected language is wrong, you can override it from the lyric settings menu.

Japanese songs can also show furigana above kanji when the option is enabled.

Translation and pronunciation data is cached. Once generated, it stays available after restarting the app. You can clear the cache for the current track or for all tracks from Settings.

## Troubleshooting

### The track is not detected

- Make sure Spotify account linking is complete in ivLyrics iOS.
- Open Spotify again and restart playback.

### Lyrics or artwork do not load

- Check that your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret are correct.
- Make sure Web API is selected in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
- Check your internet connection.
- Try saving your Spotify API credentials again from Settings.

### The wrong lyrics were selected

- Long-press the title/artist area on the main screen or lyrics page to open the menu.
- Run manual LRCLIB search.
- Choose the correct lyric result.
- If needed, clear the current track cache and load the track again.

### The lyrics are slightly out of sync

- Adjust sync offset from the lyric settings menu.
- You can fine-tune timing in 10ms, 50ms, and 100ms steps.

### Opening Spotify does not work

- Make sure the Spotify app is installed on iOS.
- Make sure Spotify is actually playing music.
- If track information has not loaded yet, wait briefly and try again.
